Through in-depth research of relevant datasets, we found that the use of fertilizers actually involves more complex considerations. In the process of using fertilizers, it is first necessary to carefully select the crops to be planted. Each crop has different soil requirements, so wise choices must be made based on the characteristics of the target crop. Secondly, the choice of soil is equally crucial. Different soil types have unique characteristics that directly affect the absorption and effectiveness of fertilizers. Based on the characteristics of the soil, fertilizers that supplement missing elements should be applied in a targeted manner. This personalized approach ensures the effective use of fertilizers, maximizing the growth and yield of crops. The overall nature of agricultural production requires a comprehensive consideration of the interactions between crops, soil, and fertilizers. Through precise selection and use of fertilizers, more effective agricultural production can be achieved while promoting sustainable agricultural development.
